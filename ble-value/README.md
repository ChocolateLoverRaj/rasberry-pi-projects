# Bluetooth Low Energy Shared Value
Read and write to a BLE characteristic from multiple different devices at the same time.

## Why
For wireless communication between the raspberry pi and a device that people interact with (phone, laptop, chromebook, computer with monitor). It can work without:
- Internet
- Wi-Fi
- Electricity (if both the raspberry pi and the other device don't need to be plugged in)

## How
Uses Bluetooth Low Energy. The raspberry pi runs a program and the other device uses a website.

## Try it yourself
On a raspberry pi (which supports BLE), go to the `server` folder and follow the instructions.

To connect to the raspberry pi, follow the instructions in the `client` folder or go to https://ble-value.netlify.app/.
